// Wraps the just_audio AudioPlayer + ConcatenatingAudioSource and owns the
// PlaybackPhase state machine. Knows nothing about audio_service queues,
// the customAction bus, or Hive — those stay in MyAudioHandler. The engine
// is the "what is the player doing right now and how do I drive it"
// boundary; the handler is the "audio_service contract + queue" boundary.
//
// Cross-class wiring uses two callbacks supplied at construction:
//   - shouldCacheSongs(): runtime check for the user's cache preference,
//     used by createSource() to choose LockCachingAudioSource vs plain URI.
//   - onTrackEnded(): fired when the engine detects the current source is
//     within 200ms of its duration during active playback. The handler
//     reacts by either looping or advancing the queue.
