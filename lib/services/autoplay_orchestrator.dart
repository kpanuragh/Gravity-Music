// Watermark-driven queue refill. Subscribes to queue + playback streams,
// computes "remaining tracks after the current one", and when that falls
// below the watermark, fetches more recommendations and appends them.
//
// The watermark is what differentiates this from naive autoplay. With a
// reactive ("queue ended → fetch next") model, the user hears a 1–3s gap
// while the rec server responds. With a predictive ("3 tracks left →
// start fetching now") model, by the time the user gets there, recs have
// already landed and playback continues seamlessly.
